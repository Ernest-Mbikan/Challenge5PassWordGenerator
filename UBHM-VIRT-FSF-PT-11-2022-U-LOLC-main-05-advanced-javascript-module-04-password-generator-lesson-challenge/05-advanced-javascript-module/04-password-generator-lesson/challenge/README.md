# Module 5 Challenge: Password Generator

## Overview

This week’s challenge requires the creation of an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they've selected.

A starter code to be modified to achieve the tasks  was provided. The app  is expected to run in the browser error-free,  and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that will be written. It is expected to have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.
